# Working Group
This is the working group for RFC and an open discussion.

It was formed to provide support to the community through the release and focus on presenting and getting feedback on the direction mincho-js is heading.
Inspired by [Rust RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) and [CSS Working Group](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts).
